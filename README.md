# AM6016-Machine_Learning
Programming assignments and notes associated with the AM6016:Dynamic Machine Learning with Applications module, as part of my MSc Bioinformatics &amp; Computational Biology degree in University College Cork.

The work here serves a uesful reference for a detailed (re-)introduction to machine learning concepts and implementation, particularly related to deep learning neural networks. 

All work is my own, unless otherwise stated.
